## Overview

As part of my undergraduate capstone at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Shidler College of Business, I worked with a team of students in the Database Consulting Group to modernize the Hawaiian and Pacific Collection's data management system at Hamilton Library.

The goal of this project was to replace the library's outdated Excel-based workflow with a scalable, cloud-based MySQL database that connects to a user-friendly website. Our solution improved access for both staff and researchers by streamlining data entry, automating reporting, and creating tools for advanced search, real-time reservations, and user feedback.

## Project Objectives

The modernization effort focused on three key objectives:

- **Streamline operations** by replacing manual Excel processes with automated database workflows
- **Enhance accessibility** for staff and researchers through intuitive web-based interfaces
- **Preserve cultural heritage** by implementing secure, scalable data management for Hawaiʻi's historical collections

## Methodology

We followed the **Rapid Application Development (RAD)** methodology, allowing us to incorporate feedback throughout the process and deliver a functional prototype that met the library's operational and preservation goals. This iterative approach enabled us to:

- Conduct regular stakeholder meetings with library staff
- Develop and test prototypes in short development cycles
- Refine features based on real-world usage and feedback
- Deliver a working system within the academic semester timeframe

## Technical Implementation

Our team designed and deployed a comprehensive database solution featuring:

- **Cloud-based MySQL database** for scalable, reliable data storage
- **Web-based interface** for intuitive data entry and management
- **Advanced search functionality** enabling complex queries across collection metadata
- **Real-time reservation system** for researchers requesting access to materials
- **User feedback mechanism** to continuously improve the system
- **Role-based access controls** to protect sensitive data and maintain security
- **Automated reporting tools** to reduce manual work and improve efficiency

## Key Outcomes

The new system delivered significant improvements:

- Enhanced operational efficiency by eliminating redundant data entry
- Reduced manual errors through automated validation
- Improved data accessibility for students, researchers, and community members
- Implemented security measures protecting sensitive collection information
- Created a foundation for future digital preservation initiatives

## Team Collaboration

This capstone project was completed as part of **ITM 354: Database Consulting Group** at the Shidler College of Business. Working collaboratively with fellow students, we applied classroom knowledge to solve a real-world problem for the University of Hawaiʻi community.

My group members were: 
- **Emma Sharp**
- **Jessica Bandol**
- **Xin Lin**
- **Lui Rabideau**
