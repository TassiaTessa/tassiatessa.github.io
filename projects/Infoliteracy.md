## Overview

This research explores the intersection of information literacy and generative AI competence in higher education. Through IRB-approved multi-phase studies, we investigated how students understand, use, and evaluate AI-generated content in academic contexts.

## Research Focus

The study examined three key areas:
- **Student proficiency** with generative AI tools in academic settings
- **Ethical considerations** surrounding AI use in education
- **Perceptions and attitudes** toward AI integration in coursework

## Methodology

Our research applied ACRL (Association of College & Research Libraries) information literacy standards to evaluate AI tool use in student writing and information literacy development. We conducted comprehensive assessments of:
- Prompt engineering strategies for content generation
- Information query techniques using AI tools
- Critical evaluation of AI-generated outputs

## Key Findings

The research provided insights into how students can develop AI literacy as a foundational skill, building on traditional information literacy frameworks. Our findings emphasize the importance of teaching students to:
- Craft effective prompts
- Critically evaluate AI-generated content
- Understand the ethical implications of AI use in academic work
- Integrate AI tools responsibly into their learning process

## Presentation

This research was presented at the **EdMedia World Conference on Educational Technology** in Barcelona, Spain in May 2025.
