  <h2 id="wod-1">WOD 1:</h2>
<p>I found wod 1 easy, This one took the most planning I spent around 15-20 minutes planning and looking at prior code I had done to remember the commands. I initially mapped it out on a separate document and realized I could order it more efficiently which is what I did while recording. The recording took about 15 minutes to make.</p>

<h2 id="wod-2">WOD 2:</h2>
<p>This was the easiest wod in my opinion, I like CSS so I enjoyed doing the basic CSS. I did not do as much planning going in but I realized that I needed to have a DIV for the photos to make it easy. So before I started the recording I brushed up on my div terminology and practiced finding and replacing to make them. As I stated in the video I probably could have done a more efficient way to find and replace it but at least what I did work. 
I had to record this twice because the first time I realized I did not have the fonts needed downloaded to my computer. So I restarted and then downloaded the fonts.</p>

<h2 id="wod-3">Wod 3:</h2>
<p>This one gave me the most trouble. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to make the columns. I consulted with chat GPT a lot but it was not a great help, I think it just wasted time. I looked back at some code my peers did in a prior class and that helped me figure out how to do it. 
However, when creating the div tags I organized the closing div tag and the closing paragraph tab wrong so it did not work, I was basically about to cry before I realized my mistake. In the end, I wish I had more time I could have spent on this WOD, I should have prioritized these wods earlier in the week so I had more time to experiment with the code.</p>
