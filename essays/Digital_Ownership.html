  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Suppose one day, you were to buy a bag of Goldfish crackers at the store. As you got home you hear a knock at the door. A representative from the grocery store is at your door and is informing you that they no longer have the rights to sell Goldfish so you must give back the pack you just bought. They may give you a refund, they may not. Regardless, you are outraged, you bought this product you own it now and they can’t just take it away! This scenario seems absolutely ridiculous, it seems improbable a company would take back a product just because they lost the rights to sell it. Yet, this happens with digital media often, if you were to hit “buy” for a movie on Amazon Prime it is completely reasonable to expect that you own the movie. Still, Amazon has the right to take away your ability to watch the movie.</p>
<h2 id="digital-media">Digital media</h2>
<p>The argument around ownership is not a new one, but as technology today has improved the argument around ownership is evolving. When most people buy a movie online, they generally expect that they own that movie, because usually when you buy something else in your everyday life such as groceries, you do own that. However, when you buy an item online like a digital video you rarely actually own that video like you would with groceries. Instead, you will usually buy the license to watch the video. Each company has different policy on this which you agree to when hitting the “I agree to the terms of service” during the sign up of the company. Most companies have terms that you cannot resell, distribute, or rent the digital media you buy. Which makes sense considering that you have simply bought the ability to watch the video and not the video itself. However, companies like Vudu, Google, and Amazon all state in their terms of service that if they lose the licensing of the video you bought, they can make it unavailable to you, even if you bought it. (Morrison, 2021)
    The examples so far have only digital media, owning something intangible will always be trick. So, what happens when you own a physical copy of something, and it no longer works? Earlier this year the sequel to the popular game “Overwatch” came out. Except the sequel, Overwatch 2, was not truly a sequel but more of a complete overhaul and update of the original game. This meant that the original game was shut down and people had the option of downloading the second version for free. The problem here is that people who spent the sixty dollars for the original game no longer had access to the game they paid for. Even with a physical disc, a customer does not own Overwatch, nor can they play the original anymore. Blizzards Terms of service is very outright with this “Your use of the Platform is licensed, not sold, to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership with respect to the Platform or the Games is being transferred or assigned and this Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights” (Blizzard End User License Agreement - Legal Blizzard Entertainment, n.d.)
Current potential solutions
When discussing digital ownership Non fungible tokens or NFT’s have recently shifted the conversation of ownership. NFT’s are marketed as a solution to digital ownership, that it is a real and profitable way to own something online that is not tangible. In a way, NFT’s are a counter to the idea that you cannot truly own anything digitally. “NFTs are certificates of ownership of a unique digital item such as a video, recording, or cyber artwork. These digital receipts reside on the blockchain (a digital ledger). Once an NFT has been “minted” – its code permanently woven into the blockchain’s DNA-like digital strands – it can be bought or sold with a cybercurrency” (Stephen Humphries 2021) The idea that you can buy an object online and sell or trade is a solution for the lack of ownership in digital media, unfortunately NFT’s fundamentally fall short in this regard. For example, when you buy a NFT of an image a flower you do not own the image of the flower, you own a token that represents that flower. This means you do not own the image of the flower, in fact not only do you not own it but if someone had access to the server where the NFT token is being held, that person could change what it represents, so suddenly instead of owning a token that represents a flower, you now have a token that represents something else entirely, (Martha M. 2022) 
The lack of true ownership is not the only reason NFT’s are a bad solution, the aforementioned “block chain” causes many other issues, the blockchain is made to be completely transparent, anyone can see anything in it, all the transactions made and who owns which NFT’s. All of this information is permanent it is extremely difficult to remove anything off the blockchain, which may seem like a good idea at first but upon further inspection its terrifying. “If someone knows your wallet address they can just put tokens directly into it…And you can’t just, like, delete it, you need to actively send it somewhere, and pay gas fees to do so. Revolutionary new vectors of harassment.” (Folding Ideas &amp; Olsen, 2022) If someone wanted to drop an image of your home address, medical records, or even revenge porn into your wallet they could, and anyone could see that through the blockchain. NFT’s are anti utilitarian, the fundamental flaw of the system has the potential to hurt many people. To recap NFT’s, you do not own what you are buying only a representation of that object, what you are buying could potentially be changed, and someone could publicly release private information that may put you in danger by using NFT’s.</p>

<h2 id="ethics-of-digital-ownership">Ethics of digital ownership</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>There is nothing inherently wrong with just selling the licensing to consume digital media. However, the companies who are selling the media should be held to much higher standards. There is a sort of façade with these companies which makes it, so the average consumer believes they own the media they bought. If you look on an Xbox console, the dashboard will display your games as “owned games” not “owned licenses.” If you do not read the terms of services its reasonable to think that when you buy something online, it’ll work the same way in real life. Under the current social contract theory in the United States if I own A Disney Princess themed monopoly board I bought, I should be able to play it even if Hasbro loses the licensing to Disney products. If that is not the case, like with digital media then it should be explicit that you don’t own the game you own the licensing. This should not be hidden away in the Terms of Service or in the licensing agreement. Because Terms of services and licensing agreements are everywhere, and I believe that people should not have to read a small book of legal jargon to be able to be treated properly by companies. 
Blizzards actions with the game Overwatch is perhaps the most worrisome. Unlike in cases where people lost access to movies or tv shows due to licensing issues, Blizzard chose to shut down Overwatch. They chose to cut access off from many people who played the game, seemingly to promote play of the new game, as of right now there are no repercussions of doing that. While the argument against Blizzard could be debated, some people may say that videogames are supposed to update and change, I want to raise the point that Blizzard marketed these two games, Overwatch 1 and 2 as separate entities, not at a massive update to the first game-as a sequel. They then acted morally wrong under Kantianism by showing a distinct lack of respect for the customers of Blizzard to take away their ability to use a product they bought.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I believe that true ownership is becoming more obsolete as we move into the future. You cannot own digital media; you can only license it. Anything you buy digitally can be taken away from you at the whim of a big corporation. The current state of digital ownership is immoral, it only serves to benefit the few and harm the many, this fails in the eyes of utilitarianism. Companies like Amazon, Blizzard, Vimeo, and Microsoft all use the implied social contract of ownership to trick us into thinking that we can own the media they sell us. While NFT’s have many fundamental problems, they at least tried to tackle the issue or digital ownership. One can only hope that another, less problematic system, comes and attempts to solve the problem of digital ownership where NFT failed.</p>
