  <h2 id="1-my-programming-skills-have-greatly-improved-in-the-following-ways">1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</h2>

<p>My programming skills have improved greatly this semester, while I always felt more confident with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">css</code> I never knew JS. This class has greatly improved my skills in javascript. To be honest I don’t get as intimidated now when I look at other peoples code.</p>

<h2 id="2-i-need-to-work-on-the-following-to-improve-my-programming-skills">2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</h2>

<p>God I am terrible at big picture stuff in programming, sure some of my small stuff can work but sometimes it feels like with my assignments my code was written by someone with dementia. I also feel like I rely too much on other sources to code. I need to try and be more confident in what I can do.</p>

<h2 id="3-i-have-learned-a-lot-from-doing-wods-and-i-can-do-them-without-copying-the-screencast">3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</h2>

<p>The POKE’s did teach me a lot, personally I felt they were more useful than the labs. I did a lot of them without heavy assistance on screencasts. Now that I have done assignment one and two (sorry about turning this in late) I feel like if you asked me to do a POKE I would breath a sigh of relief.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-labs-have-helped-me-learn-and-i-am-able-to-complete-them-with-confidence">4. The labs have helped me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</h2>

<p>I don’t feel as confident with the labs. I genuinely believe this class should have been two separate courses. Everything, especially the labs moved so fast I felt like I was being dragged along. For what it is worth, I genuinely tried to learn the materials. I took great notes, I dedicated every single Sunday to this class.</p>

<h2 id="5-i-learned-a-lot-from-my-experience-doing-assignment-1-and-feel-ready-to-work-on-assignment-2">5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</h2>

<p>If I did not submit this late, I would have said yes I would have felt ready. After I have done assignment 2 I feel like I got jumped. I did learn a lot from lab 1 and 2, might not sound like much since my assignment 2 does not work properly but that does not mean I did not learn.</p>

<h2 id="6-i-think-the-class-can-be-improved-to-help-my-learning-in-the-following-ways">6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h2>

<p>Every single assignment and instructions need to be refurbished. Someone needs to look at them and think “Oh man can the average English-speaking person understand this??”</p>

<p>Let me tell you an example I have been using a lot to explain this course.</p>

<p>In elementary school most people my age had an assignment where they had to write an essay detailing step by step how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. After all the students wrote essays the teacher would then go up and read them one by one and follow the instructions literally.</p>

<p>So if the student wrote:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put the peanut butter on the bread</li>
  <li>Put the jelly on the bread</li>
</ol>

<p>The teacher would stack an unopened jar of peanut butter and jelly on top of a unopened loaf of bread. This class felt like that, the assignments assumed we knew how “to open the jars of peanut butter and jelly” Of course, most of us are very new to programming so assuming we know how to do what may be basic programming to Dr port drove me insane.</p>

<h2 id="7-what-helps-me-the-most-in-class-are-wods-labs-class-website-screencasts-readings-quizzes-one-on-one-help-working-with-classmates-etc">7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</h2>

<p>The POKE, screencast and discord helped me the most in class</p>
