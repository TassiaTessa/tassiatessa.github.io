<p>My name is Tassia Corcoran and I am a Management Information Systems major. I was initially an art major, I love creating in all forms. However, after a few semesters in art school, I realized that I hated going to school for art. I think my issue was that I did not like the idea of spending thousands of dollars on a degree that most likely would not get me a job, and on a subject I could learn on my own time. My main issue though was the idea of monetizing my art. It felt wrong to use this thing that I had as an outlet for money, especially because when I started to make money all of the joy I got from my art was gone. It became incredibly difficult to find joy in it. 
	So after a quarter-life crisis, I decided to switch majors. I had the full intention to go into a business degree that would allow me to be creative, my goal was to be a marketing major. However, when I took ICS 101 to gain admission into the business college I found that coding in HTML is an art, and I liked creating that way. I fully understand that other coding languages may not act the same as HTML and CSS but the idea of writing something and seeing what I wrote be executable (whether in a website or a program) is incredibly interesting.</p>
